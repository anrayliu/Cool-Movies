# Blue-Movies
Watch (almost) any movie in HD and with subtitles, for free.

# Use 
Click on "main.py" to launch; press escape to quit

# Install 
1. Download the Python installer here --> https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.2/python-3.10.2-amd64.exe
2. Run the installer, but make sure you check the "Add to PATH" box 
3. Download and unzip Blue Movies 
4. Click on "setup.py" and wait for it to finish 

5. You can now use Blue Movies, but it's recommended to first download a popup blocker on your default browser

# Notes 
Uses a modified version of Sky, which I'm planning to replace soon
